<h1><a name="mminst_info">1.0 Introduction</a></h1>

<br/>
<p class="std">After installation, Dungeon Keeper uses various files from CD to run.
This includes map files - and may become a problem if you want to modify these maps.
Files on Dungeon Keeper CD are not writeable, so you have to configure the game to
use map files from your hard drive before editing anything. This instruction will
guide you through the process.</p>
<br/>

<br clear="all"/><br/>

<h2><a name="mminst_hdcopy">2.0 Copying files to HD</a></h2>
<br/>

<p class="std">First, make sure that you have Dungeon Keeper installed, and that you
know where the game is located on your hard drive.</p>
<br/>

<p class="std">Next, copy over the entire Levels, Ldata and Data directories from the
Keeper directory of the CD to your Keeper directory on your hard disk.</p>
<br/>

<p class="std">Then, go to your Keeper directory on your hard disk. You will
see a file called <i>keeper.cfg</i>. Open this in text editor (like notepad) and find
the line starting with INSTALL_PATH=. This tells the computer where the Data and Levels
directories are on the CD. Now that you have copied them to your hard disk,
you will need to alter this line. Change it so that it points to your Keeper directory 
e.g.</p>
<br/>
<p class="snip">INSTALL_PATH=c:\program files\bullfrog\keeper\</p>
<br/>

<p class="std">Lastly all the files in the Levels directory within the Keeper directory on 
your hard disk are currently set to read only. This will cause problems with 
the editor if you want to alter them. To change this in Ms Windows, go to this directory and
select all the files in it. Then right click on the files to bring up the file
menu. This may take a while due to the amount of files. When the menu appears,
click on the properties option. The properties panel will appear and you will see
at the bottom a tick box with 'Read-only' to the left of it. Click on the box to
remove the tick and click on the 'OK' button.</p>
<br/>

<p class="std">Now your levels are ready to be edited, you only need a program to
edit them. There are three such programs available, and their installation is discussed
in remaining sections of this instruction.</p>

<br clear="all"/><br/>

<h2><a name="mminst_bfedit">2.1 Official Bullfrog Editor</a></h2>

<br/>
<p class="std">On the cd will be a directory called Editor. Go to this
directory and you will see a file called &quot;editor.exe&quot;. Copy
this file and paste it into the Keeper directory on your hard
disk.</p>
<br/>

<p class="std">Then copy over the contents of the editor &quot;Data&quot; subdirectory
(inside the &quot;Editor&quot; directory of your cd) to the &quot;Data&quot; subdirectory
(inside the Keeper directory) on your hard disk.</p>
<br/>

<p class="std">Then copy over the contents of the editor &quot;Levels&quot; subdirectory
(inside the &quot;Editor&quot; directory of your cd) to the &quot;Levels&quot; subdirectory
(inside the Keeper directory) on your hard disk.</p>
<br/>

<p class="std">After performing these steps, you should be able to run
Official Bullfrog Editor by executing &quot;editor.exe&quot;.</p>
<br/>

<br clear="all"/><br/>

<h2><a name="mminst_adikted">2.2 Adikted</a></h2>

<br/>
<p class="std">Unzip the program and put all the &quot;map.*&quot; files in the same directory
and edit &quot;map.ini&quot; as appropriate (you should change paths to your DK files;
you can also change other parameters if you want).</p>
<br/>

<p class="std">After performing these steps, you should be able to run
Adikted by executing &quot;map.exe&quot;. On&nbsp;any problems, read the documentation
placed in &quot;docs&quot; subdirectory.</p>
<br/>

<br clear="all"/><br/>

<h2><a name="mminst_unded">2.3 Unded</a></h2>

<br/>
<p class="std">Unzip the program into any directory; it doesn't really matter.</p>
<br/>

<p class="std">To jump to a level that you have edited, you will need a program called
&quot;ch-dkc12.zip&quot;. You should find it inside the zip file you downloaded.<br/>
Unzip it into your Dungeon Keeper Directory.
It&nbsp;is a program which will edit one of your savegame files, and let you jump
to any level.
Use&nbsp;it to edit a savegame file and jump to the level that you have edited.</p>
<br/>

<p class="std">WARNING: You should back up your savegames first as the program
overwrites them.  The &quot;ch-dkc12.zip&quot; was created by a bloke called <i>cyberhead</i>.
Alternativly, if you don't want to use that program, you can edit the multiplayer levels.
These&nbsp;are all numbered 50 upwards.
Start&nbsp;Dungeon Keeper with the switch &quot;-1player&quot;, so for example if you have
the dos version type:</p>
<p class="snip">keeper -1player</p>
<p class="std">and for the win95 version type:</p>
<p class="snip">keeper95 -1player</p>
<p class="std">Start a new multiplayer game and select the option '1player' from the
service menu. Select your level from the map.
You&nbsp;will be taken to the level you have edited.</p>
