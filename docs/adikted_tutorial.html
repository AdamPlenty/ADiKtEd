<h1>Tutorial</h1>

<p>Adikted is a text mode tool, which makes it a little harder to use at first.
But after You'll get familiar with all functions, you will see that using
keyboard in text mode is in fact faster than editing map with mouse in
graphic-based editor.</p>

<p>This tutorial will guide you through creating a new level.</p>

<p>Please note that it was last renewed on version 0.55a, and if you're using
different version, there may be differences in commands and view.
You can always download the newest version from
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=212954">Adikted project at SourceForge</a>.</p>

<h3>Getting started</h3>

<ol>
<li><div class="rightfloatbox"><img src="dk_adikted_tutorial_keepercfg.png"/></div>
Make sure you have Dungeon Keeper installed completely on your
hard disk.To do this, go into the "keeper" directory,
and create the directories "ldata" and "levels". Copy
x:\keeper\ldata\*.* and x:\keeper\levels\*.* into these directories
respectively (replacing x: with the drive letter of your CD-Rom).
Now edit Keeper.cfg so it points to your installation. For example,<br>
<tt>INSTALL_PATH=C:\Program&nbsp;Files\Bullfrog\Keeper</tt> or <br/>
<tt>INSTALL_PATH=C:\games\keeper</tt>.</li>

<li>Go into the directory containing map.* (which is Adikted), and edit map.ini.
Change the "LEVELS_PATH" line so it points to your new "levels" directory.
This will enable you to load the original maps if you start Adikted with
a level number (eg&nbsp;"map&nbsp;15" will load level&nbsp;15 if you have set
things up correctly).<div class="clearright"></div></li>

<li><div class="rightfloatbox"><img src="dk_adikted_tutorial_areas.png"/></div>
Start up Adikted by just typing "map" then return.</li>

<li>If all is well, a screen will come up with two blue lines, one down the
middle, and one along the bottom, dividing the screen into three
areas: the map area (the left side of the screen), the information
area (the right side of the screen), and the message line (at the
bottom). The message line should have a welcome message on it.
The left side of the screen should have dark grey # characters 
on the top and left, and dots elsewhere.</li>

<li>By looking at the key in the information area, you should 
be able to see that this means there is rock to the top and left, 
and earth elsewhere. In fact, there is rock all round the dungeon -
it's just you can only see the top left corner of the dungeon to
start with.</li>

<li>The very top left corner of the screen should be highlighted.
This is your cursor. The next section will tell you how you can move
around with it.
</li></ol>

<h3>Movement</h3>
<ol>
<li>As you may have guessed (or tried already), using the arrow keys
moves the cursor around. However, if you want to go a long way, this
can take a long time. Use <b>home</b>/<b>end</b>/<b>page&nbsp;up</b>/<b>page&nbsp;down</b>
to move faster.
On some operating systems, pressing <b>ctrl</b> with any movement key
will make it go further too. Note you can see exactly where you are
with the "Position" indicator on the dividing line at the bottom.</li>
<div class="clearright"></div>

<li><div class="rightfloatbox"><img src="dk_adikted_tutorial_screensize.png"/></div>
When the cursor reaches the edge of the map area, moving it
further will scroll the map. Try moving around until you've seen the
whole border. The furthest you can go in each direction is 84, so
the bottom right hand corner of the map is 84,84.
</li>

<li>On some lame operating systems, you can't resize the ADiKtEd window
to see more of the map tiles. If you're using Ms&nbsp;Windows, and you
wish ADiKtEd window bo be bigger, click on the icon on its window title&nbsp;bar
and press "Properties". Now go to the "Layout" tab, as shown on the image.
If you think your screen is big enough to let you see the whole map,
enter the window size: Width=125, Height=87. Make sure that "Screen buffer size"
values are identical to those in "Window size", then press OK, and confirm
that you want to modify the shortcut to keep the new size every time you
run ADiKtEd. If there is not enough space, but you want to view the whole map
anyway, you can switch to "Font" tab of the "Properties" window, and select
font size "6x8".</li>

</ol>

<h3>Placing tiles</h3>
<ol>
<li>The dungeon is pretty boring at the moment, right? Time to do
something about that. Find a nice spot somewhere easy to find (near
the top left corner, for instance) - but not right on the edge.
As&nbsp;a&nbsp;rule, don't get rid of the rock on the edge.
I'm not saying anything <b>will</b> go wrong, but it might -
I don't know how Dungeon Keeper reacts at the edges.</li>

<li>Press <b>t</b> for treasure room, and sure enough a <b>t</b>
will appear on the map, under your cursor.</li>

<li>Now if you move away from it, you'll see
it's grey on a black background. That means it's not owned by
anyone. Move back onto it, and press 0. Now when you move away,
you'll see it's white on a red background. This means that it
belongs to player 0 - the human player. There are 5 players -
players 0-3 are the Dungeon Keepers, player 4 is the Lord of the
Land (spit). Pressing the number of a player sets that square to be
theirs. Note that you can't make anyone own rock or earth - they are
always unclaimed. If you will claim them, they will return to unclaimed
state on saving or updating dungeon. They are a darker grey than other
tiles to remind you of this. This means you should place something before
you own it. Pressing <b>5</b> also "unclaims" something. If you move back over the
<b>t</b>, and press <b>5</b>, then move away, it will have gone back to being
grey on black.</li>
<div class="clearright"></div>

<li><div class="rightfloatbox"><img src="dk_adikted_tutorial_legend.png"/></div>
The information area should give you an idea of what to press to
get specific tiles... basically you press the key it shows you!
There is one exception to this, which is graffiti. We'll come onto
that later.</li>

<li>Create a few small rooms, and put walls round them. Leave a path
of claimed land (<b>spaces</b>) to get from room to room though! It's often
easiest to create the rooms themselves first, then say who owns them
later.</li>

</ol>

<h3>Marking</h3>
<ol>
<li>If you created any large rooms, you may have found it fairly
timeconsuming. There must be a quicker way... it's a pretty big map,
after all! Well, of course, having said that, there's <b>bound</b>
to be. It's called marking, and you do it like this:</li>

<li>Find a spare bit of earth where you might want to create a big
room... a large lair maybe.</li>

<div class="clearright"></div>

<li><div class="rightfloatbox"><img src="dk_adikted_tutorial_marking.png"/></div>
Press <b>ctrl+space</b>. On the dividing line, it should tell you that
you're now marking, and on the message line it will say,
"Mark mode on".</li>

<li>Move around a bit... a white rectangle should appear between the
cursor and where you first pressed <b>ctrl+space</b>.</li>
<li>Mark out a nice big area... you want your creatures to have lots
of room, don't you?</li>

<li>Press <b>L</b>, and the white rectangle should be replaced by a lots of
lair tiles.</li>

<li>If you've put the new lair over earth, it will be unowned... you
need to set the ownership on the whole lot. Again, you can use mark
mode. Press <b>ctrl+space</b> again.</li>

<li>Move around so the rectangle covers the whole lair, and press <b>0</b>.
Surprise surprise, the lair should now be white on a red background.</li>
<li>Tip: If you ever start marking then want to stop, press
<b>ctrl+space</b> again.</li>

<li>Tip: You can save lots of time by laying out a lot of dungeon,
then marking the whole area to be owned by a player. The ownership
of rocks or earth will be reverted when saving, so don't worry!</li>
</ol>

<h3>Painting</h3>
<ol>
<li>Now, to make your creatures nice and safe, you may want a wall
round the lair. You <b>could</b> mark out a long thin rectangle for
each wall, but that would be a bit of a pain - you need to do each
one twice, remember - once for the wall, once for the ownership.
What you could really do with is being able to just move the cursor
around, leaving a trail of walls behind...</li>

<li>Move to the edge of the lair, where you want to start laying a
wall.</li>

<div class="clearright"></div>

<li><div class="rightfloatbox"><img src="dk_adikted_tutorial_painting.png"/></div>
Press <b>z</b>. On the dividing line and message lines, there will now
be indications that you're painting. Try moving around...</li>

<li>Nothing's happening! Don't worry, this isn't a bug... you
haven't told the editor what you want to paint with. Move back to
where you want to start laying the wall, and we'll try again.</li>

<li>Press <b>*</b>, and start moving around again. Lo and behold, a trail
of walls will be left.</li>

<li>"What about ownership?" I hear you cry. Good point. The walls
you're laying at the moment are unowned - not a good state of
affairs. So press <b>0</b> and try moving around again.</li>

<li>Made the wall? Good stuff... now you want to put down the
paintbrush. Press <b>z</b> again, and you'll stop painting.</li>

<li>"What if I want to change walls during painting?" No problem.
Just press a different key - you can paint with any of the normal
tiles, and any of the ownerships. Try painting a corridor from the
lair to the rest of your dungeon.</li>

<li>Note that pressing <b>home</b>/<b>end</b>/<b>page&nbsp;up</b>/<b>page&nbsp;down</b>,
or <b>ctrl</b> and the <b>arrow keys</b> in paint mode won't lay a trail,
as the cursor just jumpsfrom one place to another.</li>

<li>Create a few more rooms, until you're fairly happy with your
dungeon layout.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Things</h3>
<ol>
<li>Now, everyone knows there's more to Dungeon Keeper than rooms.
What about creatures, gold, spells, torches, etc? Well, it's time to
introduce you to "thing&nbsp;mode". Press <b>tab</b>.</li>

<li>The background colours will have stayed the same, but just about
everything else will have changed. Slabs will be simplified and
only show <b>#</b> and <b>.</b>, but other characters, as <b>r</b>
and <b>1</b>s will appear. The key on the right will have changed,
and a rectangle will have appeared under the ".tng entries" section
in the information area.</li>

<li>Explanation time: where there are numbers or letters, there are "things".
"Things" are objects of various different natures: spell books,
creatures, gold, dry ice effects, traps - a whole lot of stuff. You
can find out the details of these by moving over them.</li>

<li>If there aren't any numbers or letters on the screen, press
<b>tab</b> again to go back to slab mode. Draw out a big training room
(and own it), then press <b>tab</b> to go back into thing mode.</li>

<li>Move over a square with a number on, and have a look at the
information area.</li>

<li>In the ".tng&nbsp;entries" section there will be a short word somewhere.
If you're on the training room, it will probably say "Trinr".
You want to highlight that. If it's already within the
white rectangle, you've got it already and there will be a whole
load of other information. Either way, you need to learn how to move
the highlighter around.</li>

<li>Make sure <b>num-lock</b> is on. Now use the number pad <b>1</b>-<b>9</b>.
You will see the rectangle will move to the place corresponding to the key
you press. Have a play around for a minute, then highlight the word
you see there.</li>

<li>There should be some information in the top half of the
information panel. You can ignore the three lines of hex digits at
the top - they're for detailed hackery, and probably won't concern
you. Similarly, the position information may not interest you, but
the rest should come in handy. You'll be able to see what kind of
object you're looking at, and any other useful stuff about it.
Different objects can be altered in different ways:</li>

<li>Doors: go back into slab mode (with tab), and place a door. Come
back into thing mode, and take a look. It should tell you what type
of door you placed, and that's it's unlocked. Press <b>l</b> to lock it -
pressing <b>l</b> again will unlock it.</li>

<li>Creatures: Stay on the door you've just created, and press <b>c</b>.
A list of creatures will come up. Select one of them,
then press return. A short name for the creature will come up in the
highlighted spot, and the information will change. Also, there'll be
a couple of numbers in brackets just below the highlighter. That
shows which thing you're looking at on that subtile (each tile has
nine subtiles), and how many things there are there. Press <b>/</b> to
change back to the door, and you'll see that's thing no. 1 (assuming
there was nothing there beforehand).</li>

<li>Press <b>/</b> again to cycle through to the creature again. You can
now change the creature's level by pressing <b>s</b> and <b>x</b>.
 Try it.</li>

<li>Dungeon specials: change the position of the highlighter to any 
empty spot (just for convenience) and press <b>d</b>. A "reveal map"
dungeon special will come up. Press <b>s</b> and <b>x</b> to change
which dungeon special the thing is.</li>

<li>Spell books: Press <b>b</b> to create a spellbook. The first one will
be the Hand of Evil spell. Press <b>s</b> and <b>x</b> to change
to a different spell.</li>

<li>Gold: Press <b>g</b> to create a pot of gold worth 500, or <b>G</b> to create
one worth only 250. You can also use <b>s</b> and <b>x</b> to change
the value.</li>

<li>Traps: Press <b>t</b> to create a trap. Again, press <b>s</b> and <b>x</b>
to change the trap type.</li>

<li>Trap boxes: Press <b>T</b> to create a trap box (to be picked up by
your imps). Use <b>s</b> and <b>x</b> to change the type.</li>

<li>Hero gate: Press <b>H</b> to create a hero gate.</li>

<li>Dungeon heart: If you will create a 3x3 heart room in "Slab mode",
the "dungeon heart thing" will be placed automatically at center.
If you wish to make a smaller heart pedestal, or place it in some
specific place of large pedestal, you can use <b>h</b> in thing
mode to place dungeon heart.</li>

<li>Action points: Action points are used by the level script. Press
<b>a</b> to add an action point - the information panel will tell you which
number it is, for use when you write your level script.</li>

<li>"Aargh! Now I've got loads of things all over the place!" Right.
You want to delete them, don't you? Well, move over a square with a
thing in, highlight it and press <b>delete</b>. Hey presto, it vanishes.
Get rid of all the things you've created so far.</li>

<li>Pressing <b>u</b> will update the graphic (if in Slab mode) or
things (if in Thing mode) in the level - this makes sure every slab
looks like it should, or that all the training posts, torturers,
torches etc are in the right place.
Don't worry about it too much - Adikted does an automatic update when
you're changing the level. But if you see some graphic errors,
or the Official Editor acts strangely, you can update the level
to make everything work right. The automatic update may be disabled
to speed-up Adikted - in this case you should update the map before
saving.</li>

<li>Press <b>tab</b> to get out of thing mode.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Graffiti</h3>
<ol>
<li>Now onto a special feature of Adikted - graffiti. Fancy writing
a message on a wall? Dead easy.</li>
<li>In slab mode, press <b>d</b> to draw some graffiti. Go on, press it now.</li>
<li>You'll be asked to type in a message. Type in a pithy epigram...
or failing that, any old nonsense. Press return at the end.</li>
<li>Eye-catching, isn't it? Yes, the purple @ signs mean graffiti.
When you're over graffiti, the information area says what it is.
You can always remove graffiti by pressing delete.</li>
<li>Note that single graffiti is visible only from one side of the tile,
for example if it has WE (west-east) orientation, it will only
be visible from south. To see the text from both sides, you have to
create two graffiti items with oposite orientation (like WE and EW).</li>
<li>You can change graffiti orientation with <b>a</b>.
The graffiti is quite a nice effect, but I'd recommend using it sparingly.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Ready to go!</h3>
<ol>
<li>You know how to use Adikted to edit levels now. Create a small
level (you really only need a dungeon heart, and maybe try another
room).</li>

<li>Finished already? That was quick... press <b>ctrl+s</b> to save your
level. Adikted will ask you for a filename. I recommend saving it in
a temporary file first - I usually use newmap - rather than saving
straight over the original DK files to start with. If there's
anything wrong with the dungeon, such as the human player not having
a dungeon heart, Adikted will warn you with a beep and a message,
but still save the level.</li>

<li>Press <b>ctrl+q</b> to quit.</li>

<li>If you want to edit the level again, type "map newmap"
(replacing "newmap" with whatever you called your level).
Your level should appear in all its glory.
Edit it until you're happy. Save and quit again.</li>

<li>Now copy your level files over to the levels directory, with a
command like this:<br/>
<tt>copy newmap.* c:\games\keeper\levels\map00001.*</tt><br/>
I recommend using level 1, as it's easy to get to.</li>

<li>Fire up Dungeon Keeper, and you're ready to go... press Start
New Game (if you copied it over level 1) and see what happens.
It may well instantly say you've won the game - that's 'cos you haven't
changed the level script. The script would require a different
tutorial... it doesn't really matter as far as Adikted is concerned
though. To learn about the script, check Official Editor documentation.</li>

<li>You're now ready to go back and design a proper level to fox all
your friends. Remember, you can press F1 at (almost!) any time in Adikted and
get help for whichever mode you're in. Inside the help, you will find many
options that are not mentioned in this tutorial - don't forget to check it.
Good luck, and I hope you enjoy using Adikted!</li>

<li>Tip: Use <b>ctrl+l</b> to load a level within Adikted, and <b>ctrl+n</b> to
start a new level.</li>

<li>Tip: Use <b>ctrl+r</b> to automatically generate a level background.</li>
